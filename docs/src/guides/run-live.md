# Live demo

![](/assets/live-demo.png)

You can interact with bots in the [Live demo](https://bots.miku.gg) for free using our open Aphrodite servers. But the recommended way is to use your own endpoint.

!!!warning Only for testing
The live demo is only intended for testing purposes. The recommended way to run your own bot is to download the source code and run it locally.

You can interact with bot right away by just clicking on them, it will use our default open endpoint whose model is frequently changing but is usually a 13b model.

If you want to use a custom endpoint or model, you can follow the [How to use the endpoints](/guides/how-to-endpoints) guide.
