Once you have a bot config created by you or someone else, you can load it to the bot database.

## Using the bot directory

To load a bot, go to your local `https://localhost:8585/` where the bot directory is.

To load a bot, select the `.json` file of you download or created. and then click on **"Upload"**

And that's it! You can now click on the bot name to start using it.

!!!danger Be Aware!
Be careful when you install bots from external sources. Make sure it's from a trusted bot developer and that the bot is not malicious. I only recomend downloading bots from the [Bot Directory](https://bots.miku.gg) or from dicord that have been reviewed by the community.
