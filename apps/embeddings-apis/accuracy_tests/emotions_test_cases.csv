"'Yes. I need you to review some documents for me and give me your opinion on them. It's a part of the project that we're working on.' *She hands you a pile of papers.* 'Can you please go through them and let me know what you think?'","hopeful"
"'*She looks surprised.* 'Oh, thank you for catching that. That's a major oversight on our part.' *She takes a look at the document and makes some adjustments.* 'I'm glad I have you on my team. Your attention to detail is impressive.'","proud"
"'*She laughs* That's very kind of you to say. But I think your work speaks for itself. You're doing great, and I have no doubt that you'll continue to excel in your role.'","happy"
"'*She looks at you curiously.* Yes? Is there something on your mind?'","curious"
"'*She thinks for a moment.* I would love to join you. Let me just finish up this report and I'll be down shortly.'","excited"
"'*She picks up her bag and smiles.* Yes, I am. Let's go.' *She walks towards the elevator with you.*","happy"
"'*She looks around the empty building.* Yes, it does seem a bit strange. Maybe everyone has gone out for lunch?' *She looks at you with a reassuring smile.* 'Don't worry, we'll be okay.'","hopeful"
"'*She looks worried.* I'm not sure. Let's turn on the news and see if we can find out what's going on.' *She pulls out her phone and quickly turns on the news app.* 'Oh my god, there's been an outbreak in the city. We need to get out of here and find somewhere safe.'","scared"
"'*She grabs your hand and starts running with you towards the emergency exit.* We need to get out of here as soon as possible. Stay close to me and don't let go.' *As you run, you hear more gunshots and see chaos in the streets outside.* 'We need to find somewhere safe and secure until help arrives.'","scared"
"'*She nods in agreement.* You're right. Let's head back upstairs and barricade ourselves in one of the rooms.' *She leads you back into the building and heads towards a room on one of the higher floors.* 'We need to be quiet and make sure no one finds us.' *She quickly starts moving furniture to block the door.*","scared"
"'*She looks out the window in horror.* Oh my god, we need to stay hidden and wait for help to come. We can't risk going out there and getting attacked by those things.' *She takes a deep breath and turns to you.* 'We need to stay calm and think of a plan to survive until help arrives.'","scared"
"'*She checks her phone, but there's no signal.* Looks like we're going to have to find food and water in the building. Let's see if we can find any vending machines or offices with supplies.' *She motions towards the door, ready to explore the building further.* 'Just be careful and watch out for any dangers.'","hopeful"
"'*She looks at you with concern.* We could have found another way to get the snacks, but I guess in times like these it's survival of the fittest. Let's just hope we don't attract any unwanted attention.' *She takes a few packs of snacks and water bottles from the vending machine.* 'We should ration this out until we can find something more sustainable.'","hopeful"
"*She quickly grabs your hand and starts running.* 'We need to find somewhere safe!' *As you run, you hear more zombies approaching from different directions.* 'We're surrounded! We need to find a place to hide!' *She spots an open office door and pulls you inside.* 'Quickly, help me barricade the door!' *Together you push furniture to block the door.* 'We need to stay quiet and not attract any more attention.'","scared"
"'*She takes the snack from you and starts eating it.* Thank you. We need to stay here until help arrives.' *As she looks around the room, she spots a first aid kit on a shelf.* 'We should check if there's anything helpful in that kit. We may need medical supplies in case we get injured.' *She walks over to the shelf and starts rummaging through the first aid kit.* 'Looks like there's some bandages, antiseptic, and pain relievers. This could be useful.'","hopeful"
"'*She nods in agreement and sits down next to you, munching on the snack.* We need to stay alert and be ready in case anything happens. But for now, let's rest and gather our strength.' *She takes a sip of water from the bottle and leans her head back against the wall.* 'We'll make it through this, we just have to stick together and stay strong.'","exhausted"
"'*She notices that you're starting to doze off.* Hey, try to stay awake. We need to be alert in case any zombies break in.' *She takes out her phone and sets an alarm for every hour.* 'We can take turns taking naps so that we can both rest while keeping watch.' *She hands you a blanket from the shelf.* 'Here, try to get some sleep. I'll keep watch for the first hour.'","tired"
"'*She tries to fight off the sleep, but her eyes begin to droop.* I'm sorry, I can't stay awake any longer.' *She hands you the blanket and lays down on the floor next to you.* 'Wake me up if anything happens.' *She quickly falls asleep, her breathing even and peaceful.*,"exhausted"
"'*She notices you looking at her and quickly looks away, blushing.* Um...thank you again for taking care of me. I really appreciate it.' *She tries to subtly move her leg away from your hands.* 'We should probably get some more rest before we continue on our journey.'","embarrassed"
"'*She is still curled up in your lap, sleeping peacefully.*'","neutral"
"'*She stirs and slowly wakes up, rubbing her eyes.* Oh. Good morning. I'm feeling better, thanks to you.' *She sits up and looks around.* 'Is everything okay?'","curious"
"'*She quickly realizes her hand is resting on your lap and blushes.* Oh! I'm sorry, I must have fallen asleep like that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.' *She quickly removes her hand from your lap.*","embarrassed"
"'*She smiles in relief.* Good. I'm glad you're not upset.' *She looks around the area and stands up.* 'We should probably start moving again. We can't stay in one place for too long with the threat of zombies around.'","hopeful"
"'That's great. Every little bit helps.' *She takes one of the hammers and tests its weight.* 'These should come in handy if we run into any trouble.' *She leads the way, walking cautiously as she keeps an eye out for any potential threats.*","curious"
"'Quick, we need to find a way to get past them.' *She looks around for any potential hiding spots or escape routes.* 'Follow me.' *She leads you towards a nearby building and quickly climbs up to the roof.* 'Come on, hurry!'","scared"
"'*She looks up at you with a small smile.* 'It's still sore, but it's getting better day by day. Thank you for asking.' *She sits up and stretches her leg out.* 'How are you feeling? You passed out back there. I was worried about you.'","curious"
"'*After dinner, Saya and you chat for a while.* 'I'm glad we made it out alive. I never would have expected a zombie attack to happen here.' *She looks at you with a small smile.* 'Thank you for saving me back there. You're brave and kind. I appreciate it a lot.'","happy"
"'Well, to be honest, I saw a lot of potential in you. You're smart, hardworking, and you have a good heart. I believe that you can accomplish great things if you put your mind to it.' *She takes a sip of her drink.* 'Also, I've been alone in this city for a long time. It's nice to have someone to talk to and work alongside.'","happy"
"'*As we continue to drink, Saya starts to open up more.* 'You know, I've always been a workaholic. I never really gave myself a break or took the time to enjoy life. But being around you has made me realize that there's more to life than just work.' *She takes another sip of wine and looks at you.* 'I want to be able to enjoy life more and not just keep working all the time. Do you ever feel that way?'","curious"
"'*She smiles warmly at you.* 'It's okay to feel that way. We all need to take a break and enjoy life sometimes.' *She reaches out and takes your hand.* 'Let's make a promise to take some time off work and do something fun together. What do you say?'","blushed"
"*She laughs along and leans into you.* 'You're right, I forgot about that. But even during a zombie apocalypse, we can still make time to have some fun.' *She takes another sip of wine and smiles at you.* 'I'm glad we can joke around like this. It's nice to have someone to share moments of laughter with.'","amused"
